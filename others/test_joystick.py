# In this example the function joystick_transform will transform the
# square shaped joystick axis information into a circular shape.
# This will make the new joystick axis information easier to use while
# moving around a character or cursor.

# The RED dot represents the actual joystick information.

# The BLUE dot represents the transformed joystick information.

# The GREEN dot is a cursor that moves by the transformed joystick
# information in a motion relative to it's previous location.
