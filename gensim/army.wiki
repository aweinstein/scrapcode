[[File:Army.afnews.jpg|thumb|Soldiers in an army.]]
The '''army''' is the part of a [[country|country's]] [[military]] that fights on the ground. People in the army are called [[soldier]]s. Many modern armies have [[vehicle]]s such as [[tank]]s, [[airplane]]s, and [[helicopter]]s to help soldiers fight on the ground.

A soldier may be a volunteer (someone who joins something because they want to), or he may be drafted (forced by the government to join the army). Forcing men to join the army is called ''conscription'' or ''draft''. Voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers, but high in confidence and quality. Drafted armies are large, but often lacking in confidence and in quality: it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will.

A soldier does many things, from shooting enemies, to using binoculars to find out where enemies are. They are used to defend their country, or attack another country's army. It is difficult, and a soldier must be in good shape, both physically and mentally. They almost always move together, and that way the team can do more things, in a safer way. They may be assigned to certain places to guard, or they may be told to search a place, or even attack it. That is up to their commander. Every soldier answers to someone else, so that way, everything is organized.

== Gear ==
A soldier is supplied with weapons, such as [[gun]]s, [[knife|knives]], and other simple gear for surviving in the battlefield, such as [[food]], [[water]], [[clothing|clothes]], and [[tent]]s. They must keep good care of the items.

== Qualifications ==
Before a soldier joins the army, he must qualify to be in it first. The person is put through tests, so that the army will know if the recruit can do it or not. This is sometimes called 'boot camp'. He must complete mental tests, and physical tests. It depends on where he is testing that will tell him how hard it will be. He will also take tests to determine what job he will do in the military. For instance, he may work with computers or be a cook for the soldiers, or he may be very good with a rifle and be a [[sniper]]. There are a lot of jobs that a person can choose to do in the army.
